This is our EHR system called E-DOC

The code is primative as you mentioned in the pdf. That's the reason it does not have many features and the design is very simple. 

Currently the system works on local machine, we did not work on the deployement because it was taking very long and not really required in this course. We have mentioned all the other details in the project report.

## Troubleshooting

### Application Not Loading Properly

- **Issue:** Sometimes the application may not load correctly on the first attempt.

- **Solution:** If you see an error message or the page isnâ€™t loading as expected, try refreshing your browser (`F5` or `Ctrl + R`). This can often resolve temporary issues with the application loading process.

### Docker Container Issues

- **Solution:** Check the Docker logs to identify any errors:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
